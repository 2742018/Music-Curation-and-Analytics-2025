    <h2>Task 1: Identifying a Theme for the Dataset</h2>

	<h3>Theme: Koji Kondo’s music for The Legend of Zelda series.</h3>
	  
    <p>
    For my dataset, I’ve chosen to focus on <strong>Koji Kondo’s compositions for The Legend of Zelda video game series</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
	This theme feels personally meaningful to me because I have always been drawn to the emotional impact and atmosphere that Kondo’s music creates. His melodies have shaped how many players experience the Zelda universe, blending nostalgia, adventure, and wonder.
    </p>
   <p>
	What makes this theme particularly intriguing for data work is its intertwining of music, technology, and storytelling. The series, spanning almost four decades and multiple gaming systems — from the original NES to the Nintendo Switch — demonstrates a fascinating evolution of musical ideas alongside technological advances. Analysing melody, harmony, rhythm, and instrumentation within this consistent creative framework allows me to study the intricate ways game music adapts to changing hardware while preserving its signature sound.

  <h2>Task 2 — Types of Data</h2>

  <p>
    To investigate <strong>Koji Kondo’s</strong> compositions for <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series, this project collects and analyses three primary types of data: <strong>musical scores (notated data)</strong>, <strong>metadata (descriptive data)</strong>, and <strong>audio recordings (acoustic data)</strong>. Together, these data types create a comprehensive foundation for exploring Kondo’s compositional style, his use of recurring motifs, and the evolution of his sound across multiple gaming generations.
  </p>

  <!-- Musical Scores -->
  <h3>• Musical Scores — Notated (Symbolic) Data</h3>

  <p>
    Musical scores provide a symbolic representation of Kondo’s work, allowing for detailed analysis of his melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structures. By studying transcriptions of his themes, it becomes possible to trace how motifs develop and reappear throughout the <em>Zelda</em> franchise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several fan-curated arrangements and piano reductions can be found through websites such as <a href="https://musescore.com/" target="_blank">MuseScore</a> and <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com/" target="_blank">Musicnotes</a>. These platforms include popular renditions of pieces like <em>“Overworld Theme,” “Zelda’s Lullaby,”</em> and <em>“Song of Storms.”</em> While many of these resources are community-created, they still provide valuable notated data for analysis, especially when official sheet music is scarce.
  </p>
  <p>
    Officially licensed sheet music, such as <em>The Legend of Zelda™ Series for Piano</em> (Nintendo, 2011), offers accurate arrangements directly sanctioned by Nintendo. Additionally, community MIDI repositories provide symbolic data that can be imported into notation or analysis software such as <strong>MuseScore</strong> for deeper harmonic or structural study.
  </p>

  <!-- Metadata -->
  <h3>• Metadata — Descriptive and Contextual Data</h3>

  <p>
    Metadata provides the descriptive backbone of this dataset, detailing each composition’s context, authorship, and distribution. Key metadata fields include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Track title and any alternate names (e.g., “Main Theme” vs. “Overworld Theme”).</li>
    <li>Game title and release year.</li>
    <li>Composer and arranger credits.</li>
    <li>Instrumentation and sound format (e.g., chiptune, orchestral, hybrid).</li>
    <li>Track length, publisher, and distribution platform.</li>
    <li>Genre classification and in-game context (e.g., title screen, dungeon, battle, overworld).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The <a href="https://vgmdb.net/" target="_blank">Video Game Music Database (VGMdb)</a> is one of the most comprehensive metadata sources, providing detailed soundtrack listings, catalogue numbers, release dates, and composer credits for official <em>Zelda</em> soundtracks. The <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/" target="_blank">Zelda Wiki</a> supplements this information by documenting how each track functions within the games — for example, identifying where specific pieces play during boss battles, overworld exploration, or narrative cutscenes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Streaming platforms such as <strong>Spotify</strong>, <strong>Apple Music</strong>, and <strong>YouTube Music</strong> also provide standardised metadata fields including track length, release year, genre classification, and album details. In addition, fan and academic commentaries — such as YouTube breakdowns or blog analyses — can contribute qualitative metadata by providing interpretive and production-related insights.
  </p>

  <!-- Audio Recordings -->
  <h3>• Audio Recordings — Acoustic Data</h3>
  <p>
    Audio recordings represent the acoustic realisation of Kondo’s work and are essential for understanding its timbral, textural, and performance characteristics. These recordings reveal how Kondo’s compositions evolved from early 8-bit soundscapes to modern orchestral performances.
  </p>
  <p>
    Official soundtracks are widely available on streaming platforms such as <strong>Spotify</strong>, <strong>Apple Music</strong>, and <strong>YouTube</strong>, as well as on physical formats including CDs and vinyl. Archives such as <a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/" target="_blank">KHInsider</a> preserve original in-game audio files, including those from older consoles, stored in proprietary formats like <code>.brstm</code> and <code>.bfstm</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Live orchestral adaptations, most notably <em>The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses</em>, add another dimension of acoustic data, presenting official orchestral interpretations of Kondo’s music. Meanwhile, fan-created remixes, covers, and re-orchestrations hosted on <strong>YouTube</strong> and <strong>SoundCloud</strong> demonstrate the community’s active engagement and reimagining of Kondo’s work.
  </p>
  <p>
    These recordings can be examined using spectral analysis or waveform comparison to observe variations in timbre, tempo, and dynamic range across different releases — from the 1986 NES soundtrack to modern orchestral versions such as those found in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> (2017).
  </p>

  <h2>Task 3: Challenges in Working with Music and Music-Related Data</h2>

  <p>
	Working with music-related data presents a range of challenges that relate to access, copyright, data quality, and standardisation. In the case of <strong>Koji Kondo’s compositions for The Legend of Zelda series</strong>, these challenges become particularly evident due to the hybrid nature of video game music as both a commercial product and a cultural artefact. The following section outlines the major obstacles encountered in collecting, curating, and analysing this data, supported by examples and evidence from relevant sources..
  </p>

  <h3>1. Copyright and Access Restrictions</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most significant barriers to working with music data is copyright. As Nintendo owns Kondo’s work, access to official scores and high-quality audio recordings is tightly controlled. This limits researchers and fans to unofficial or secondary sources such as fan-made transcriptions or community-uploaded audio files. These materials are valuable for preservation and analysis, but they lack the authority and consistency of officially sanctioned releases. For example, while <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-and-laced-records-announce-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vinyl-soundtrack-collection/?srsltid=AfmBOordcIVC90HEMSW0xsn0xWDmQE_k4HZ3BqhgEITw0xWVYrV6csGo&utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">Nintendo</a> has recently begun issuing official soundtrack collections and vinyl releases, these are limited in scope and availability, reinforcing the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive primary data.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Fragmented and Inconsistent Metadata </h3>
  <p>
    Another challenge is the lack of metadata standardisation across different platforms and archives. Kondo's music appears on a variety of sites — such as VGMdb, Zelda Wiki, and fan repositories — each of which uses slightly different naming conventions and data structures. For example, a single track might appear as “Main Theme,” “Overworld Theme,” or “Hyrule Field Theme”, depending on the source. Such inconsistencies complicate efforts to catalogue or compare works across multiple datasets. This fragmentation highlights the absence of a central, authoritative database for video game music and demonstrates the need for more unified metadata frameworks.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Authenticity and Availability of Notated Data</h3>
  <p>
	Obtaining accurate musical scores for analysis is also difficult. Unlike classical or commercial pop music, video game scores are rarely published by the composer or studio. Most notated materials are community-produced, often relying on audio transcription rather than access to original sheet music. While platforms like MuseScore host hundreds of Zelda arrangements, these vary widely in quality and fidelity to Kondo’s original compositions. This suggests that when researching, there is a need to balance accessibility with accuracy, and cross-referencing multiple fan versions to approximate a reliable representation of the music.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Audio Format and Analytical Limitations</h3>
  <p>
	The technical nature of video game sound also introduces analytical constraints. Early Zelda titles used limited 8-bit and 16-bit sound chips, while later games employ orchestral recordings and dynamic, adaptive scores. Audio extracted from game files is often stored in proprietary or compressed formats, which require conversion and can degrade sound quality. Such transformations make detailed timbral or frequency analysis less precise. Moreover, audio found in fan archives may have been edited, normalised, or looped, altering its original structure.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Decentralised Presentation and Community Curation</h3>
  <p>
	The music in Zelda exemplifies both the richness and fragmentation of digital music ecosystems. The data exists across diverse formats and platforms: official soundtrack releases, fan websites, YouTube remixes, orchestral concert recordings, and academic studies. While this community-driven activity ensures cultural preservation and accessibility, it complicates data provenance and reproducibility. Each platform has its own methods of cataloguing, annotating, and presenting material, resulting in a mosaic of overlapping but inconsistent data sources.
  </p>

  <h3>Overall:</h3>
  <p>
	Koji Kondo’s Zelda music shows the challenges of digital music curation and analysis. Copyright restrictions limit direct access to primary materials, while fragmented metadata and inconsistent notational data complicate systematic study. Despite these limitations, the widespread community engagement with this music — through fan archives, online transcriptions, and live performances — demonstrates both the enduring cultural impact of Kondo’s work and the potential for collaborative, grassroots preservation in the absence of centralised official archives.
