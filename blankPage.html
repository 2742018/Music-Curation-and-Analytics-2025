    <h1>Week 1 Response:</h1>
    
<h2> Task 1 - Identifying a Theme: </h2>

Theme: "The Music of Koji Kondo for The Legend of Zelda (1986-1998)"

Notated Data: Sheet music books are commercially published. For earlier 8-bit games, the data can be represented as MIDI files or tracker module files, which are essentially code-based scores.

Acoustic Data: Original soundtracks (OSTs) are widely available. You can also find recordings of symphonic arrangements ("The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses").

Descriptive Data: Interviews with the composer, analysis of how the music functions interactively within the game, and fan-created wikis that meticulously catalog musical themes and their associations.


<h2> Task 2: </h2>

1) Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? 

- Access and copyright: 
- The Ephemeral and Interactive Nature of the Data:
- Data Curation and Standarization:
- The "Derivative Works" Ecosystem:

2) How does your selected theme display some of these challenges?

  - Copyright Manifestation:

3) Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.
