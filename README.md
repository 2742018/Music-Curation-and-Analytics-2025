# Portfolio for Music Curation and Analytics  
### Focus: Koji Kondo and *The Legend of Zelda* Video Game Franchise  

This repository presents an academic and creative portfolio exploring music data curation and analysis within the context of Koji Kondo’s compositions for *The Legend of Zelda* series.  

This repository contains the supporting materials for my portfolio submitted for the Music Curation and Analytics module. It includes encoded musical data, audio analysis outputs, MEI metadata files, and Python-based analytical work. The contents here function as the technical backbone to the curated portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages.
