<!-- WEEK 1 -->
Week 1 Response:

Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? I am running a few minutes late; my previous meeting is running over.
How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? I am running a few minutes late; my previous meeting is running over.
Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.\
